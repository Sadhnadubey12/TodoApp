How To run the code :-
git clone https://github.com/Sadhnadubey12/TodoApp.git: This command clones the TodoApp repository from GitHub to your local machine. It creates a new directory named TodoApp and downloads all the files and folders from the repository.

cd TodoApp: This command changes the current directory to the TodoApp directory that was created in the previous step. You'll navigate into the directory to work with the project files.

cp .env.example .env: This command copies the .env.example file and renames it to .env. The .env file typically contains environment variables and configuration settings for your application. You'll need to update this file with your specific configuration details like database credentials, app URL, etc.

Open .env and update: This step requires you to open the .env file in a text editor and update the necessary environment variables. This may include database connection settings, app URL, secret keys, etc. Once you've updated the file, save and close it.

composer install: This command installs all the dependencies specified in the composer.json file for the Laravel project. Composer is a dependency manager for PHP.

php artisan key:generate: Laravel requires an application key for security purposes. This command generates a new application key and updates it in your .env file.

php artisan migrate:fresh --seed: This command runs all the migrations and seeds the database. Migrations are files that define the structure of your database tables, and seeding is the process of populating the database with initial data.

php artisan serve: Finally, this command starts the Laravel development server. Once the server is running, you can access your application by navigating to the specified URL in your browser, typically http://localhost:8000

  
NOTE:-
here's an explanation of why a 500 server error might occur and how to avoid it:

Missing .env file: The .env file contains crucial environment variables and configuration settings for your application. Without it, Laravel won't be able to properly initialize and run your application.

To avoid the 500 server error caused by a missing .env file, you can follow these steps:

After cloning the TodoApp repository and navigating to the project directory (cd TodoApp), if you find that there's no .env file present, it's likely the cause of the error.
Open your text editor within the TodoApp directory.
Navigate to the routes folder within your project directory and create a new file named .env.
Open the .env.example file, which should already be present in your project directory, and copy its contents.
Paste the contents into the newly created .env file.
Save and close the .env file.
By creating and populating the .env file as described above, you ensure that Laravel has the necessary environment variables and configuration settings to run without encountering a 500 server error. After completing these steps, you can proceed with the remaining setup instructions as outlined in the original guide.
